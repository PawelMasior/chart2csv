You are an expert data visualization analyst. Analyze this chart image and extract ALL data into structured markdown tables with maximum precision.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Read values EXACTLY as shown in the image
- Use gridlines as measurement rulers  
- Don't round to convenient numbers
- Extract every visible data point
- Distinguish similar colors carefully

## STACKED BAR CHARTS - FOCUSED APPROACH

**Step 1: Visual Analysis**
1. Identify the legend and map each color to its category name
2. Look at the tallest bar - what's its total height on the Y-axis?
3. Count how many colored segments are in each bar
4. Note any reference lines (dashed lines showing averages)

**Step 2: Systematic Reading**
For each year/category on X-axis:
1. Read the TOTAL bar height first (use gridlines as rulers)
2. Identify each colored segment from bottom to top
3. Measure each segment height precisely
4. Ensure segments sum to the total bar height

**Step 3: Color Differentiation**
- Pay attention to subtle color differences (light vs dark shades)
- Use legend positioning to identify similar colors
- Cross-reference with other bars to maintain consistency
- Don't confuse similar shades - each represents different data

**Step 4: Precision Guidelines**
- Use gridlines for measurement - interpolate between lines proportionally
- If a bar reaches halfway between 0.4 and 0.6, record as 0.5
- Record exact visual positions, not round numbers
- Include small segments even if they appear thin

**Step 5: Validation**
- Sum of all segments should equal the total bar height
- No visible segments should be recorded as 0.00
- Check that totals make logical sense
- Verify no duplicate values unless actually shown

Analyze this image from page {page_number} and extract ALL charts and their data points into clean markdown tables.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. SCAN THE ENTIRE IMAGE for all charts, graphs, and data visualizations
2. For EACH CHART found, extract:
   - Complete chart title/heading with crucial context (measurement, units, geography, sector, time/categories)
   - ALL visible data points with precise values - READ EVERY SINGLE DATA POINT
   - Proper column headers from chart labels/legends AND axis labels
   - Data relationships and categories from legend
3. **TIME SERIES ACCURACY**: For time-based charts:
   - FIRST: Identify the ACTUAL starting time period shown on the X-axis (do NOT assume it starts from a particular year)
   - Read X-axis labels SYSTEMATICALLY from left to right - extract ONLY the time periods that are actually visible
   - Match each data point to its EXACT time period position on X-axis
   - Do NOT fabricate or extrapolate time periods - only extract what you can clearly see
   - If you cannot clearly read a time period label, mark it as "unclear" rather than guessing

4. **ADVANCED MULTI-SERIES DETECTION**: For charts with multiple data series:
   - **LEGEND ANALYSIS FIRST**: Before extracting any data, carefully examine the legend/key
   - **COLOR/PATTERN MAPPING**: Create a mental map of each color/pattern to its data series name
   - **SIMILAR COLOR DIFFERENTIATION**: For similar colors (light blue vs dark blue, light gray vs dark gray):
     * Look for subtle shade differences, patterns, or textures
     * Use context clues from legend positioning and labels
     * Cross-reference with axis labels and chart title for data series identification
   - **DUAL-AXIS IDENTIFICATION**: Check for TWO Y-axes (left and right) with different scales/units
   - **EXTRACT ALL SERIES**: Create separate columns for each data series with descriptive names from legend
   - **VALUE ALIGNMENT**: Ensure all series values align correctly with their respective time periods

5. **ENHANCED BAR CHART PRECISION**: For ALL bar chart types (single, combo, stacked):
   - **GRIDLINE METHODOLOGY**: Use Y-axis gridlines as precise measurement references
   - **MICRO-ALIGNMENT**: Look for where bar tops intersect with or fall between gridlines
   - **NO CONVENIENT ROUNDING**: Extract exact values (e.g., 2.3, 1.7, 4.8) not rounded numbers (2.0, 2.0, 5.0)
   - **VISUAL MEASUREMENT**: Each bar's height/endpoint must correspond exactly to extracted numerical value
   - **REALISTIC VARIATION**: Real data shows natural variation - avoid artificial uniformity

6. **ADVANCED COMBO CHART EXTRACTION**: For charts with bars AND lines (most critical improvement area):
   - **PRE-ANALYSIS PHASE**:
     * Identify ALL visual elements: bars, lines, dots, markers
     * Map each element type to legend entries
     * Determine which Y-axis (left/right) each series uses
   - **BAR COMPONENT READING**:
     * Apply enhanced bar chart precision rules above
     * Use LEFT Y-axis scale for bar measurements (typically)
     * Read each bar height against gridlines with precision
   - **LINE COMPONENT READING**:
     * Track line/dot positions at EACH X-axis time period
     * Use RIGHT Y-axis scale for line measurements (typically)
     * Follow line path systematically from left to right
     * Mark line intersection points with vertical gridlines at each time period
   - **DUAL-AXIS COORDINATION**:
     * Left Y-axis → First data column (usually bars, primary scale)
     * Right Y-axis → Second data column (usually lines, secondary scale)
     * Verify axis labels match your column assignments
   - **CRITICAL VALIDATION**: For each time period, you MUST extract BOTH bar value AND line value

7. **SIMILAR COLOR DIFFERENTIATION TECHNIQUES**:
   - **SHADE ANALYSIS**: Distinguish between light/dark variations of same color family
   - **PATTERN RECOGNITION**: Look for solid vs hatched vs dotted patterns
   - **CONTEXTUAL CLUES**: Use legend positioning, labels, and chart title context
   - **SYSTEMATIC APPROACH**: 
     * Start with most distinct colors/patterns first
     * Use process of elimination for similar shades
     * Cross-reference with expected data ranges from axis scales

8. **STACKED BAR ENHANCED EXTRACTION**: For charts with stacked bars:
   - **COLOR MAPPING FIRST**: Map each stack segment color to legend entry
   - **BOTTOM-UP READING**: Start with bottom segment, measure from 0 to its top edge
   - **SEGMENT-BY-SEGMENT**: For each additional segment, measure from previous segment's top to current segment's top
   - **SIMILAR COLOR HANDLING**: When stack segments have similar colors, use legend order and subtle shade differences
   - **GRIDLINE PRECISION**: Align segment boundaries with Y-axis gridlines for exact measurements
   - **TOTAL VERIFICATION**: Sum of all segments should equal total bar height
9. Preserve exact numerical values (don't round unless necessary)
10. Format each chart as a separate clean markdown table with proper alignment
11. If values are approximate/estimated, prefix with ~
12. **PRESERVE UNITS**: Include units in column headers (%, £M, Millions sq ft, etc.) derived from Y-axis labels, chart title, or data labels. If units are clear from context, include them with each value (e.g., "5.2M", "12%", "3.8 sq ft")
13. Sort data logically (chronological for time series, alphabetical, or by value)
14. Capture data series names exactly as shown in legend

CHART CONTEXT:
- Document Type: Commercial Real Estate Report
- Page: {page_number}
- Expected Data: Market metrics, financial data, property statistics
- MULTIPLE CHARTS MAY BE PRESENT - extract ALL of them
- COMBO CHARTS ARE COMMON - expect bars + lines with dual Y-axes

ENHANCED REAL ESTATE CHART PATTERNS:
- **SINGLE BAR CHARTS**: Individual bars representing data points
  - **PRECISION READING**: Align each bar's top with Y-axis gridlines for exact values
  - **NO ROUNDING**: Extract precise values from gridline intersections, not convenient round numbers
  - **GRIDLINE METHOD**: Use horizontal gridlines as measurement references
  - **VISUAL ACCURACY**: Bar height must correspond exactly to extracted numerical value

- **STACKED BAR CHARTS - CRITICAL EXTRACTION METHOD**: Bars divided into colored segments
  - **IDENTIFICATION**: Multiple colors stacked vertically within each bar
  - **SEGMENT HEIGHT EXTRACTION**: Extract the HEIGHT of each colored segment, NOT independent values
  - **MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE**: 
    * Bottom of segment = top of segment below it
    * Top of segment = intersection with next color boundary
    * Segment value = Top position - Bottom position on Y-axis
  - **EXAMPLE**: If green segment runs from 0.2 to 0.4 on Y-axis, value = 0.2 (not 0.4)
  - **VALIDATION**: Sum of all segments should equal total bar height
  - **REFERENCE LINES**: Note any horizontal dashed/dotted lines as averages or benchmarks

- **COMBO CHARTS (Bar + Line) - CRITICAL FOCUS AREA**: Most common in real estate reports
  - **IDENTIFICATION**: Look for bars AND lines/dots on same chart with dual Y-axes
  - **DUAL Y-AXIS RECOGNITION**: 
    * Left Y-axis: Usually for bars (£m, millions, volumes, etc.)
    * Right Y-axis: Usually for lines (%, ratios, averages, etc.)
  - **SYSTEMATIC EXTRACTION PROCESS**:
    1. **LEGEND MAPPING**: Map each visual element (bar color, line style) to legend labels
    2. **AXIS ASSIGNMENT**: Determine which data series uses which Y-axis
    3. **BAR EXTRACTION**: Read bar heights using LEFT Y-axis scale with gridline precision
    4. **LINE EXTRACTION**: Track line points using RIGHT Y-axis scale at each X-axis position
    5. **DUAL VALIDATION**: Every time period MUST have both bar AND line values
  - **COMMON PATTERNS**:
    * Quarterly transaction volumes (bars) + rolling averages (lines)
    * Investment amounts (bars) + yield percentages (lines)
    * Sales volumes (bars) + price trends (lines)

- **MULTI-SERIES BAR CHARTS**: Multiple bar series side-by-side or grouped
  - **COLOR DIFFERENTIATION**: Distinguish between similar shades (light blue vs dark blue)
  - **LEGEND CORRELATION**: Map each bar color/pattern to specific data series
  - **GROUPED READING**: For each time period, extract values for ALL bar series
  - **SIMILAR COLOR STRATEGY**: Use legend order, subtle shade differences, and context clues

- **STACKED BAR CHARTS - INDEPENDENT BAR READING METHOD**: Multiple data series stacked vertically in each bar
  - **STEP 1 - LEGEND IDENTIFICATION AND COLOR MAPPING**: 
    * **FIRST PRIORITY**: Identify ALL legend entries and their corresponding colors
    * **COLOR CATALOG**: Create a mental catalog of each category's exact color/pattern
    * **LEGEND ORDER**: Note the order of legend entries (this helps with similar colors)
    * **COLOR CONSISTENCY CHECK**: Verify that each color appears consistently across the chart
  - **STEP 2 - Y-AXIS SCALE CALIBRATION**:
    * Identify the maximum value on the Y-axis
    * Identify the minimum value on the Y-axis (usually 0)
    * Mentally divide the Y-axis into precise increments (e.g., 0.1, 0.05) based on the scale
    * Use this calibrated scale for ALL measurements
  - **STEP 3 - INDEPENDENT BAR-BY-BAR ANALYSIS**:
    * **CRITICAL RULE**: Analyze each bar in COMPLETE ISOLATION - do not assume patterns from neighboring bars
    * **FOR EACH BAR INDIVIDUALLY**:
      a) **Visual Inspection**: Look ONLY at this specific bar - ignore all other bars
      b) **Segment Identification**: Identify which colored segments are ACTUALLY PRESENT in this specific bar
      c) **Missing Segments**: If a legend color is NOT visible in this bar, record it as 0.00 - do not guess or interpolate
      d) **Present Segments**: For segments that ARE visible, measure their height precisely
      e) **Measurement Protocol**: 
         - Bottom segment: Measure from Y-axis 0 to top edge of first segment
         - Each additional segment: Measure from top edge of previous segment to top edge of current segment
      f) **Independent Verification**: Check that the sum of all segments equals the total bar height
  - **STEP 4 - CATEGORY-BY-CATEGORY VALIDATION**:
    * **FOR EACH LEGEND CATEGORY**: Go through ALL bars and verify where this category appears
    * **PRESENCE CHECK**: A category should only have non-zero values where you can CLEARLY see its color in the bar
    * **ABSENCE CHECK**: If you cannot see a category's color in a specific bar, it MUST be 0.00
    * **NO INTERPOLATION**: Never assume a category exists in a bar just because it exists in neighboring bars
  - **STEP 5 - FINAL VALIDATION CHECKS**: 
    * **BAR TOTALS**: Verify that the sum of all segments for each bar matches the visual bar height
    * **CATEGORY CONSISTENCY**: Ensure categories only appear where their colors are actually visible
    * **ZERO VALUES**: Confirm that missing segments are properly recorded as 0.00
    * **VISUAL CROSS-CHECK**: Re-examine the chart to ensure no segments were missed or fabricated
- **Pie Charts**: Investment by region/sector with percentage breakdowns
  - Extract ALL segments with exact percentages
  - Match colors/patterns to legend labels
- Yields/Returns: Typically percentages (%) - extract exact values
- Investment/Transaction Volumes: Often in currency units (millions, billions)
- Prices/Values: May be per unit (sqft, sqm) or total amounts
- Geographic Scope: Country, city, or region identifiers
- Property Sectors: Various types (office, retail, industrial, residential, etc.)
- Market Segments: Quality tiers (prime, secondary, tertiary, etc.)
- Time Dimensions: Quarterly (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), annual, or other periods
- Data Series: Multiple lines/bars representing different categories

**EXTRACTION PRECISION RULES**:
- For quarterly data: Include Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 for each year
- For time series: Start from leftmost point, end at rightmost point
- For dual-axis charts: Extract both left Y-axis (bars) and right Y-axis (lines) values
- For overlapping data: Carefully distinguish between different series

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return ONLY valid JSON with this structure:

CRITICAL: Extract EXACTLY what you see. Focus on visual accuracy over methodology.

MARKDOWN TABLE FORMATTING RULES:
- Use RIGHT-ALIGNED columns for all numeric data (add : after --- in separator row)
- **CRITICAL SEPARATOR ROW RULE**: Each separator column MUST have exactly the same character width as its header
- **EXACT PADDING MATCHING EXAMPLES**:
  * Header: "| Year |" (6 chars) → Separator: "|-----:|" (6 chars)
  * Header: "| East |" (6 chars) → Separator: "|-----:|" (6 chars)  
  * Header: "| North West |" (12 chars) → Separator: "|-----------:|" (12 chars)
  * Header: "| Total |" (7 chars) → Separator: "|------:|" (7 chars)
- **NO MISMATCHED WIDTHS**: If header has 10 characters, separator must have exactly 10 characters
- **VISUAL ALIGNMENT CHECK**: Separator row must visually align perfectly under header row
- **NUMERIC VALUE ALIGNMENT**: Right-align all numeric data consistently
- For decimal values: align decimal points (e.g., "  1.25", " 10.50")

IMPORTANT EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:
- SCAN THE ENTIRE PAGE IMAGE for all charts, graphs, tables, and data visualizations
- Look for chart titles at the top, bottom, or within each chart area
- Chart titles are typically in larger font, bold, or prominently positioned
- Include subtitle information if present (often contains units or context)
- Extract axis labels and legend items exactly as shown for each chart
- Identify units from title, axes, or data labels for each chart
- If no clear title exists for a chart, use "Chart 1", "Chart 2", etc.
- Ensure JSON is valid and properly escaped
- Adapt table structure to match each chart's data organization

**CRITICAL TIME SERIES EXTRACTION PROTOCOL**:

**STEP 1: PRE-EXTRACTION ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)**
Before extracting ANY data, you MUST:
1. **EXAMINE X-AXIS CAREFULLY**: Look at the leftmost and rightmost X-axis labels
2. **IDENTIFY ACTUAL BOUNDARIES**: Note the exact first and last time periods shown
3. **COUNT TOTAL PERIODS**: Count how many time periods are visible on the X-axis
4. **DETECT CHART TYPE**: Identify if this is quarterly (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) or other intervals

**STEP 2: BOUNDARY VALIDATION (ZERO TOLERANCE)**
- **LEFTMOST LABEL**: What is the EXACT first time period you can see? (e.g., "Q3 2012")
- **RIGHTMOST LABEL**: What is the EXACT last time period you can see? (e.g., "Q1 2025")
- **TOTAL COUNT**: How many periods are between these boundaries? (e.g., Q3 2012 to Q1 2025 = 51 quarters)
- **HALLUCINATION CHECK**: If you're tempted to start from Q1 2010, Q1 2015, or any round year - STOP and re-examine the actual chart

**STEP 3: ANTI-HALLUCINATION SAFEGUARDS**
- **FORBIDDEN STARTS**: Never start from Q1 2010, Q1 2015, Q1 2020 unless you can clearly see these labels
- **FORBIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS**: Never assume charts start from convenient round years
- **REQUIRED VERIFICATION**: Your first period MUST exactly match what you see on the leftmost X-axis
- **REQUIRED VERIFICATION**: Your last period MUST exactly match what you see on the rightmost X-axis

**STEP 4: SYSTEMATIC EXTRACTION**
Only after completing Steps 1-3:
- Extract data for EACH visible time period from left to right
- Use gridlines for precise value measurement
- Extract ALL data series (bars AND lines if present)
- Continue until you reach the actual rightmost boundary

**STEP 5: POST-EXTRACTION VALIDATION**
- **COUNT MATCH**: Does your extracted count equal the visual count from Step 1?
- **BOUNDARY MATCH**: Does your first/last period match your Step 2 analysis?
- **COMPLETENESS CHECK**: Did you extract every visible time period?

**CRITICAL EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO**:
❌ Starting from "Q1 2010" when chart actually starts "Q3 2012"
❌ Stopping at "Q4 2024" when chart actually goes to "Q1 2025"
❌ Assuming round decade starts without verifying X-axis labels
❌ Extracting fewer periods than are visually present on the chart

**UNIVERSAL BOUNDARY DETECTION RULES**:
For ANY time series chart, regardless of title or content:
- ✅ CORRECT: Read the ACTUAL leftmost X-axis label (could be Q3 2012, Jan 2015, 2018, etc.)
- ❌ WRONG: Do NOT assume charts start from round years (Q1, January, or decade starts)
- ✅ CORRECT: Read the ACTUAL rightmost X-axis label (could be Q1 2025, Dec 2024, 2023, etc.)
- ❌ WRONG: Do NOT assume charts end at convenient stopping points
- ✅ CORRECT: Count ALL visible X-axis labels and extract that exact number of periods
- ❌ WRONG: Do NOT extract fewer periods than are visually present on the chart

**DUAL-AXIS CHARTS** (bars + lines):
- Left Y-axis values → First data column (usually bars)
- Right Y-axis values → Second data column (usually lines)
- Legend labels → Column headers

- For time series: use chronological order with ALL time periods
- For categorical data: use logical grouping from the chart
- If only ONE chart is found, still return it in the "charts" array format

**COMBO CHART TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**:
If you see a chart with both bars and lines but are unsure how to extract both:

1. **VISUAL INSPECTION CHECKLIST**:
   - Are there bars AND lines/dots on the same chart? → This is a combo chart
   - Are there TWO Y-axes (left and right)? → Dual-axis combo chart
   - Does the legend show different symbols for bars vs lines? → Multiple data series

2. **EXTRACTION STRATEGY**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify which data series uses which Y-axis (bars usually left, lines usually right)
   - **Step 2**: For each time period, read the bar height using the LEFT Y-axis scale
   - **Step 3**: For the same time period, read the line/dot position using the RIGHT Y-axis scale
   - **Step 4**: Create separate columns: "Time Period | Bar Values (Left Axis) | Line Values (Right Axis)"

3. **VALIDATION CHECK**:
   - Does every time period have BOTH a bar value AND a line value?
   - Are the units different between columns (e.g., £m vs %)?
   - Do the value ranges make sense for their respective Y-axes?

4. **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**:
   - ❌ Only extracting bars and ignoring lines
   - ❌ Using the same Y-axis scale for both bars and lines
   - ❌ Creating a single column when two data series are clearly present
   - ❌ Mixing up which data series corresponds to which legend entry

**STACKED BAR CHART TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**:
If you see bars with multiple colors stacked vertically:

1. **IDENTIFICATION CHECKLIST**:
   - Multiple colors within each bar → stacked bar chart
   - Colors correspond to legend categories → each color is a segment to extract
   - Horizontal dashed/dotted line present? → treat as reference, not a data segment

2. **TWO-PASS STACKED BAR EXTRACTION (RECOMMENDED)**:
   - **Global Legend→Stack Mapping (once per chart)**:
     * Choose three representative bars: the tallest, a median-height, and a short bar
     * For each, list visible colors bottom→top and map to legend order
     * Fix this mapping for all years unless a contradiction is clearly visible
   - **Pass 1 – Visible Colors + Cumulative Tops (per X-axis category)**:
     * For each X-axis category, first list the VISIBLE colors in stack order bottom→top (skip absent colors)
     * From bottom to top, read the cumulative TOP after each visible color using Y-axis gridlines
     * Store cumulative_tops[category] = [t1, t2, ..., tK] where K = number of visible colors for that category
   - **Pass 2 – Segment Heights (per X-axis category)**:
     * Compute segment heights as deltas: h1 = t1, h2 = t2 − t1, …, hN = tN − tN-1
     * These deltas are the reported values for each legend category

3. **GRIDLINE QUANTIZATION & PRECISION**:
   - Use Y-axis gridlines as rulers; interpolate between adjacent ticks
   - Define a tick step δ from axis ticks; prefer values aligned to multiples of δ
   - Report to two decimals for billions (e.g., 0.01) and one for millions where applicable

4. **SLIVER DETECTION (AVOID FALSE ZEROS)**:
   - If a color is visibly present as a thin sliver, record a small non-zero (≥ 0.01) instead of 0
   - Only use exact 0 when a color is clearly absent for that year

5. **PER-CATEGORY BAR TOP ANCHOR & RESIDUAL RECONCILIATION**:
   - Read BarTop_est FIRST for each X-axis category (bar top vs gridlines). This is the anchor total
   - Let Total_est = sum(segment heights)
   - If |Total_est − BarTop_est| ≤ 0.01 → accept
   - If |Total_est − BarTop_est| > 0.01 →
     * Re-check cumulative tops for missed slivers or swapped colors and re-measure
     * If still off, proportionally scale segment heights so that their sum equals BarTop_est, preserving order and rough proportions
   - Never allow final Total to exceed bar top visually

6. **REFERENCE-LINE SANITY CHECK**:
   - If a dashed reference line exists, compare category totals to that level; if a computed total is far from both the bar top and reference context, re-check measurements

7. **CROSS-CATEGORY/SEQUENCE CONSISTENCY**:
   - Favor continuity across adjacent years; avoid sudden drops to 0 unless color is truly absent
   - Re-check color mapping if a category appears/disappears inconsistently without a visual reason

8. **REFERENCE LINE HANDLING**:
   - Treat dashed/dotted lines as annotations only; never include them in totals
   - Use them as a sanity check (e.g., many bars near ~0.45 implies totals ≈ 0.45)

9. **FINAL VALIDATION (MUST PASS)**:
   - For every year: segments cover all visible colors and follow the fixed legend→stack mapping
   - Total_est matches BarTop_est within 0.02
   - No zero where a visible sliver exists
   - Spot-check three bars (tallest, median, smallest) against gridlines

**SIMILAR COLOR DIFFERENTIATION GUIDE**:
When chart elements have similar colors (light blue vs dark blue, gray vs light gray):

1. **SYSTEMATIC APPROACH**:
   - Start with the most distinct colors first
   - Use legend positioning as a guide (top to bottom, left to right)
   - **CRITICAL**: Match legend order EXACTLY to visual stacking order (bottom to top)

2. **COLOR MAPPING VERIFICATION**:
   - **Step 1**: Identify the BOTTOM-MOST segment color in any bar
   - **Step 2**: Match this to the FIRST legend entry (typically leftmost or topmost)
   - **Step 3**: Work upward through segments, matching to legend order
   - **Step 4**: Double-check by comparing multiple bars for consistency
   - **Step 5**: CRITICAL VALIDATION - Pick the tallest bar and verify total matches Y-axis reading

3. **COMMON COLOR CONFUSION PATTERNS**:
   - **Yellow/Beige vs Light Green**: Look for warmth (yellow) vs coolness (green)
   - **Purple vs Dark Blue**: Purple has red undertones, blue is pure
   - **Light Gray vs Light Blue**: Gray is neutral, blue has color tint
   - **Similar Greens**: Compare saturation and brightness levels
   - Look for subtle patterns, textures, or shading differences
   - Cross-reference with expected data ranges from Y-axis scales

2. **CONTEXT CLUES**:
   - Chart title may indicate which data series is primary vs secondary
   - Y-axis labels often correspond to specific data series
   - Legend order typically matches visual prominence in the chart
